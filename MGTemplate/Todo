GuideLines to project:

Components are things such as :Health, Texture,Position,Hitbox etc...

Systems act on components within entitys or create components for use with Entities.

Entitys are built up of multiple components and systems which act on those components.

For multiple Systems to share information a Manager is made and used. Also for a Entity to speak to a manger a system is used.
